# Astatine
Astatine is an open-source chat server/API. The purpose of it is to be able to make your own client for a chat app without having to deal with coding a backend.

## API Docs
Haven't started making the documenation yet.

## Current main server
In the future, I want there to be an easy-to-access server that you don't have to self-host. However, currently the backend is still being worked on, so there will be no main server yet.

## Self hosting
(WIP)
